Hi, I'm Kaloyan. I'm a machine learning specialist who loves building things.

I have a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics, but what really gets me excited is taking an idea from a whiteboard sketch to a working application. I have hands-on experience developing projects like AI-powered tutoring systems and competitive game-playing bots using Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

I'm currently looking for a full-time role in Data Science or AI where I can join a creative team and help tackle the next set of interesting problems.

As you can see from the photo, when I'm away from the keyboard, I'm probably on a hiking trail or a sailboat.

<!-- #### Research Interests
My research has spanned high-dimensional probability, numerical analysis, machine learning, and neural networks. Most recently, I developed a probability-based bound for the spectral norm of expansive matrices, connecting abstract mathematics with real-world data science problems.

I am excited to apply my analytical skills to meaningful projects in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.
